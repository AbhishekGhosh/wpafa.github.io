<a id="about-the-plugin" class="anchor" href="#about-the-plugin" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Plugin.</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of the plugin is to help developers create interactive business applications using WordPress and AngularJS. The plugin itself is not an application, it is just a component to standardize POST requests/responses between front-end AngularJS Page Templates and backend Model Layer built by the developers.</p>

</h3>
    <p>WordPress is the most popular Blogging and Websites framework exists nowadays. It represents the core of the business model for many companies, developers, and designers out there. A lot of them added great features to it and made it more profitable and energetic.
    </p>
    <p>Most of these additions and features comes in the domain of Blogs, Websites, eCommerce, and Portals. But what about dedicated web solutions for Small/Medium business? Such as CRM, Accounting, Contact Management, Internal Business Operations Workflow, and others. Could we utilize WordPress to build such applications?!</p>
    <p>In fact, yes we could. I found many articles on the internet talking about this subject and the most notable one I found written by "Tom McFarlin" <a href="https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin" target="_blank" title="Tom McFarlin @ Twitter">@tommcfarlin</a>. He wrote a series of articles under the title "Using WordPress for Web Application Development" and you can find them on http://goo.gl/Gc4uWf. In these articles he talks about the difference between an "Application Framework" and "Application Foundation", and why we should deal with WordPress as application foundation.</p>
    <p>Back in March 2015, our firm in Amman got a client looking to manage his business workflow. The budget was very tight, and I was the only developer. So I were looking to find a solution to complete the project in hand without going into building the software totally from scratch. At the end I managed to create the application using WordPress with the help of the wonderful plugin pods.io.</p>
    <p>On November 2015, we got another client looking for custom Accounting/Financial System also with very limited budget. So again we used WordPress to do that. But this time we used a better infrastructure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We created a different plugin for each module (Clients, Vendors, Core Accounting, etc…) and created Pages Templates within the plugins as the system pages.</li>
      <li>We used AngularJS to build an interactive attractive front end pages.</li>
      <li>To server the AngularJS we created a WordPress page template which accept POST requests and return JSON data. This was core REST API of the application.</li>
      <li>For the reports we used plain HTML.</li>
      <li>For the widgets of the Dashboard we used AngularJS Templates.</li>
      <li>For the roles and privileges we made custom post types using pods.io plugin. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The structure we used is not the best one exists, but it was suitable, scalable, and most importantly it finished the job.</p>
    <p>When we built this framework, we were planning to use it for all the following web application we have. So we made the plugins tightly coupled with the theme. Especially that the theme is great and have a lot of nice touches for the user experience.</p>
    <p>Now we are looking to create something reusable by other developers. This what made us create this plugin. It is very simple, direct to the point, and still in the early stages.</p>
    <h3><a id="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h3>
    <p>
      We made few applications using this framework, you can find the below sample videos for the application we built using WordPress.

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure the plugin is reusable and understandable by the developers.</li>
      <li>Make sure the plugin is secure and safe to use by developers.</li>
      <li>Increase the usage of WordPress for business application development.</li>
    </ol>
